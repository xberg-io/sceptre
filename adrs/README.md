# Architecture Decision Records

This directory holds the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in
[MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format.

## Conventions

- One decision per file, named `NNNN-kebab-title.md`, numbered sequentially.
- Each ADR carries a `status` (`proposed` | `accepted` | `rejected` | `superseded`),
  a `date`, and `deciders`.
- ADRs are immutable once accepted. To reverse a decision, add a new ADR that
  supersedes the old one; mark the old one `superseded by NNNN`.
- Add an ADR whenever a choice between real alternatives has lasting consequences
  (a dependency, backend, algorithm, public API shape, model source, or target
  strategy). See the `adr-discipline` rule in `.ai-rulez/rules/`.
