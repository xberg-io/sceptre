"""Publish benchmark numbers from a measured run into the committed docs.

The head-to-head harness (:mod:`sceptre_rs_tools.benchmark`) writes
``benchmark-results/comparison.json``, which is gitignored and machine-local. Every
number quoted in the README and on the docs site used to be copied out of such a run by
hand, so nothing tied a published figure to the run that produced it, and nothing noticed
when the two drifted apart.

This module closes that loop:

* ``publish`` distils a comparison report into ``benchmarks/published/latest.json`` — a
  small, committed, stable-schema artifact carrying the headline figures *and* the
  ``environment`` provenance block naming the runtimes that produced them.
* It then renders the headline table from that artifact into every marked region in the
  README and the docs site, so the published tables are generated output, not prose.
* ``--check`` re-renders from the *committed artifact* and fails if the committed tables
  disagree with it. It never reads the gitignored measurement report, so it works on a
  fresh clone with no benchmark run behind it — no torch, no models, no release binary —
  and is cheap enough to run on every pull request.

A published number is only as good as its provenance: a report with no ``environment``
block is rejected rather than published, because the resulting table could not be
attributed to any particular runtime.
